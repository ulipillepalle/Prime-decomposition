# Prime-decomposition
Prime decomposition
We keep a number, for ex. 12
and we want to know the prime stored in this number:
Result:  2 * 2 * 3  or 3 * 2 ^ 2
this result is possible, when the prime-numbers stored in a file can be scanned.
The largest prime-number file (50billion or 5E10) is not stored in this place, because of a size of more then 25 GB.
For tests i've added a file with prime till 1000.
For the result of greater numbers have a look at ulipillepalle/Prime-Numbers.
